# Predicting Custmore Loyalty Score Using ML


Our client, a grocery retailer, hired a market research consultancy to append market level customer loyalty information to the database. However, only around 50% of the clientâ€™s customer base could be tagged, thus the other half did not have this information present.

The overall aim of this work is to accurately predict the loyalty score for those customers who could not be tagged, enabling our client a clear understanding of true customer loyalty, regardless of total spend volume - and allowing for more accurate and relevant customer tracking, targeting, and comms.

To achieve this, we looked to build out a predictive model that will find relationships between customer metrics and loyalty score for those customers who were tagged, and use this to predict the loyalty score metric for those who were not.
